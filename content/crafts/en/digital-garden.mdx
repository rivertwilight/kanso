You might wonder why so many people use Obsidian when it's seemingly just a plain editor.

Many "save everything" products try their best to reduce friction for you — browser extensions, WeChat article saving, Raycast plugins, and the like.

The core of Obsidian's approach is that it _increases_ the friction of saving things. Putting something in requires you to manually organize and categorize it; otherwise, you can't save it effectively.

For example, when I find a post on X that I like, I first need to download the video, then find a suitable Note or Canvas in Obsidian to store it. To make it easy to search later, I also need to carefully think of an appropriate title or tag.
Similarly, if it's a text post, I need to manually copy it into Obsidian, fix the formatting, and then summarize it with a title.

Another example: when I find an excellent motion design video, I organize it into Detail — a process with extremely high friction. I have to download the video first, then create a new file, write a title, a summary, add tags, and finally put the video in.

This seemingly crude "digital garden" approach has greatly improved how I filter content, effectively weeding out noise and letting only truly valuable content enter my garden.

You might ask: what if I miss out? What if I want to find it later and can't? The answer is: "If something is truly important, it will find its way into your mind." What you're putting into your bookmarks might not be that link — it might be your anxiety.

You might feel that once something is in your bookmarks, you won't lose it — it's already "yours." I often fall into this habit too: I must quickly capture everything that interests me, and I'll organize it later when I have time.

But just like the content-flooded internet, if your garden is overrun, it eventually becomes an overgrown wasteland. **Quality matters far more than quantity.**

So, back to the title: a good digital garden should be a "high-friction" digital garden, not a place where you can toss in anything. It might be an Obsidian Vault, or better yet, a website you maintain by hand. The key is: **you need to constantly prune, organize, and cultivate it — not just leave it there and rest easy, hoping it might be useful someday.**

Inspiration happens during that high-friction process, not in the relief of a one-click save. It's like how the best doodles from childhood were casually drawn in the margins of textbooks — no fancy canvas needed.

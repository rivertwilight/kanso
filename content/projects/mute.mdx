[Mute](mute.ink) is my first project in 2026.

Mute is an AI-powered interactive fiction engine. Describe a scene, then live it — with branching choices, immersive prose, and stories that never repeat.

## What's next

## One more thing

I built a similar text RPG when I was 16, for my classmates. It's called [Adventure X](game.rene.wang).

It is well known that Blender heavily relies on shortcuts. In addition to shortcuts, there are many small tips that can improve the efficiency of Blender working for you. This article summarizes some productivity-enhancing tips.

The version of Blender used in this article is 3.6 LTS. Long-term updates.

## F3 to Invoke Global Search

Pressing F3 at any time brings up the global search box, allowing you to search for any function.

For example, if you forget where the "Extrude" tool is, just type Extrude to quickly access it.

## Reset Properties

Hover the mouse over any value input box and press Delete to reset that value.

## Quick Access to Documentation Pages

Similar to resetting properties, hover the mouse over a specific input box and press F1 to quickly open the online documentation for that function.

## Use Mathematical Operations

In places where you need to input values, you can not only enter values directly but also input mathematical expressions, and Blender will automatically calculate the result.

## Object Masking

Sometimes when dealing with internal spaces, you may want to mask out external objects. For example, if you want to work on the internal structure of a box, you can enable X-Ray or zoom in to the inside. However, you can also use Alt + B (Option + B) to invoke the masking mode, and then use the mouse to select the area to mask, temporarily hiding the objects (without making actual modifications to them).

Pressing Alt + B again will close the mask.

## Quick Switch Render Modes

In addition to using the menu in the upper right corner,

## Invert Selection of Objects

## Open the Last Closed Panel

After creating a Mesh or applying a Modifier, there is usually a configuration panel. If you accidentally close this panel by pressing Enter or otherwise, you can press

## Adjust Panel Scaling

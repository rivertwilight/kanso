## New Year's Eve

On June 13, 2019, I was lying on my dorm bed at the second middle school, worried about whether I would sleep poorly and if it would affect my math exam the next day.

On the evening of June 14, 2019, the day the high school entrance examination ended, I rushed into my room and bought my first server.

On June 15, 2019, teachers and students attended the graduation ceremony. Just before school ended, a classmate threw a lollipop at me, and little did I know that candy would almost become a farewell.

On June 16, 2019, I took Eastern Airlines flight `CA4532` to Chengdu. My parents deceived me; I didn't say goodbye to my classmates, didn't pack my memories, and left in a hurry. I arrived in Chengdu in the afternoon and stayed at my father's classmate's house.

On June 17, 2019, I hurried to Chengdu Shishi High School to participate in the independent enrollment exam.

On June 18, 2019, just as I was about to enter the exam room at Chengdu Shishi High School, I received the admission notice (parallel class). With a tumultuous heart, I finished the second exam.

On June 21, 2019, I went on a pilgrimage to Emei Mountain with my father.

On June 22, 2019, since the house in Chengdu was under renovation, my father sent me to the countryside to play.

Half of a neglected summer vacation had passed.

## Chengdu Shishi High School

On July 21, 2019, I participated in a two-week summer camp (bridging class) at Chengdu Shishi High School. My first encounter with a stranger in Chengdu was with the lovely Yuting. I met my first homeroom teacher, Mr. Dong.

On July 30, 2019, my bicycle was stolen, and after reporting it, it vanished without a trace.

Throughout August 2019, I lived on instant noodles, alone, watching movies, traveling, and coding on my phone.

In September 2019, we had a week of military training. I met Jinxuan in classroom 509 and Siyuan in the classroom.

On September 24, 2019, I suffered a head injury, got three stitches, and returned home to recuperate. I was fortunate to become a beta user of MIUI 11.

## The DingTalk Era

On January 19, 2020, I bought a new bicycle — Merida Explorer 100.

On January 20, 2020, I rode naked to Dujiangyan, covering over 80 kilometers.

On January 23, 2020, I returned to my hometown and became one of the first people in Sichuan to wear a mask. The cold winter in the south was quite uncomfortable; I preferred the serious snow of the north.

On February 10, 2020, the DingTalk era began. I attended classes every day, slacked off in the group chat, video-called, watched dramas, and produced countless lines of code.

## New Students

On April 20, 2020, I returned to campus and met my classmates for the next two years, getting to know Yajie and Leilei.

On May 2, 2020, I went out with my classmates for the first time in a meaningful way.

- KTV
- Walking

On May 9, 2020, students in Chengdu took off their masks.

On May 20, 2020, students from Experimental Middle School returned to school.

On May 30, 2020, I went on my second outing. I seriously made a vlog and wrote a [travelogue](./记五月三十日游.md).

- Jinli
- Jinjiang

On June 13, 2020, I bought a new server and wrote this memoir.

## Afterword

This article records the year after my high school entrance examination, or rather, the year I came to Chengdu, the people I met, and the experiences I had. I hope to be someone who can "tell my story wonderfully," like Fugui in "To Live."

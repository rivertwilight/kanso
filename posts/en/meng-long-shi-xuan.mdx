The result of goodbye  
Is always a reunion

Every love exists in the heart  
Every past is in dreams

I have only a simple hope:  
To maintain the tranquility of the first bloom.”

Every day  
To be a poem  
With every word a star?”

So, the mountains rise  
People say: I want to live  
So, the flood recedes.”

I want to take her into the days to come  
Quietly all the way.”

People easily sleepwalk in the moonlight  
Desiring to obtain and understanding

As if forever separated  
Yet dependent for a lifetime  
This is true great love

That connects us together  
It is another storm, another lamp  
That makes us part ways.”

But the realm of the heart is vast.”

“If there were no farewells and reunions  
If one dared not bear joy and sorrow  
What meaning would the soul have  
What would life be called?”  
—(Shu Ting)

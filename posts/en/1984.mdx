George Orwell's "1984" is a landmark work of dystopian literature that profoundly reveals the terrifying nature of totalitarian societies.

The novel depicts a world ruled by "Big Brother," where thoughts are monitored, history is altered, language is simplified, and personal freedom is nonexistent. The protagonist, Winston Smith, struggles to survive in this oppressive society, attempting to seek truth and freedom.

Through this work, Orwell warns people to be vigilant against the abuse of power and the control of thought. Concepts such as "doublethink" and "Newspeak" in the book continue to remind us of the importance of maintaining independent thought.

## Marriage at the Gate of the Underworld

It was a day when you wouldn't need an umbrella but would still get wet; the summer in Chengdu is always filled with continuous rain.

After giving up on the Changteng Ghost School, the two of us chose `K Space Escape Room`. We teamed up with four others to challenge the most difficult and terrifying theme, "Marriage at the Gate of the Underworld."

After seeing the character I drew, "Guard," we were blindfolded and led into a small dark room. Strangely, why did we need to wear blindfolds for something that was just a door?

**This article contains spoilers**

### Room 1

When Jin Xuan and I poked a candle into a glass-like hole, a ghostly face suddenly lunged at us, making me consider quitting. From then on, I became wary of similar openings.

Based on a note as a clue~~and a lot of hints from the staff~~, we successfully reached the next room.

### Room 2

We rescued a bride trapped in a booth resembling a phone booth. The lightning and the white-clothed ghost sent my dopamine levels soaring.

Based on a couplet as a clue~~and a lot of hints from the staff~~, we successfully reached the next room.

### Room 3

Using a compass and a note as clues~~and a lot of hints from the staff~~, we successfully cracked the code, but due to misalignment of the mechanism, we wasted a lot of time, which became a regret.

### Room 4

This room had a lot of individual tasks, and teammates were called out one by one, with occasional screams and sounds of collisions. Fortunately, as the guard, I was not called out.

After cracking the spirit tablet code, we crawled through a dog hole into the final room. Four large coffins stood there, as if inviting us to enter.

Just as we were worried, time was up, and the staff signaled us to stop and explained the following plot. It turned out that one of the maid (Jin Xuan)/guard/little Si was possessed by a ghost as soon as they entered the door. When we put on the blindfolds, special fluorescent powder was sprinkled on our hands. Under special lighting, the markings would appear. The coffins were indeed prepared for us; once inside, a ghost would randomly take one person, and after everyone rescued them, they would return to the previous room, where the ghost would reveal its true form under the light. The bride and groom would bow to their parents, and the game would end.

In summary, it wasn't terrifying, but it kept you on edge, making you watch every piece of darkness; at least that's how I felt.

## Interdimensional Co-habitation

This is how a romantic film should be. The female lead is beautiful, the story is exciting and slightly mind-bending. I highly recommend this movie; the few post-credit scenes tell a story that will leave a man silent and make a woman cry.

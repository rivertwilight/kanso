The DC-3 is a very interesting aircraft. To master this plane, you need to understand its temperament.

It uses the Pratt & Whitney R-1830 engine, which is an air-cooled engine. This means that any actions must be taken "slowly," unlike modern jet aircraft where you can "push the throttle hard."

It is a typical mechanically controlled aircraft; pulling the yoke forwards and backwards operates the control surfaces (elevator, ailerons, etc.) through steel cables.

MSFS 2024 offers two versions: a modern GPS version and a classic version.

## Cold Start & Taxiing

If you often watch World War II movies, you will notice that many fighter planes require ground crew to manually start the engines. Similar to the APU in modern aircraft, the DC-3 needs an Energizer to "blow up" the engines.

The Energizer controls a small engine that connects to the main engine through a mesh. Therefore, you need to start the Energizer first, then start the mesh to engage the starter with the main engine.

1. Start the external power and set the throttle to about 10%
2. Open the cooling fins to full
3. Select fuel tanks for both engines
4. Start the left booster
5. Start the left engine Energizer
6. After five seconds, start the left engine mesh
7. Set the left engine magneto to maximum
8. Prime the left engine
9. Repeat the same steps for the right engine
10. After hearing the engine start smoothly, turn off the booster

## Takeoff

1. Lock the tailwheel (if not locked, it will cause swaying during taxiing)
2. If flying at night, turn on the landing lights
3. Slowly push the throttle to full. The DC-3 is an air-cooled engine, and pushing it to full immediately can cause the temperature to rise rapidly, potentially leading to engine overheating.
4. Pull the yoke back at 120 knots

Due to the torque effect of the propeller and slipstream, the propeller will push the aircraft to the left. Therefore, you need to apply right rudder to ensure straight flight.

## Cruising

On the classic model without GPS, you need to fly visually or use NDB. Here’s a brief introduction on how to use NDB.

First, you need to find the NDB on the map. Each NDB has its own frequency. Start the NAV on the top panel radio and adjust the knob to the corresponding frequency to receive the NDB signal (Morse code).

For example, the NDB frequency for the first checkpoint of the Hump Route, Ferts Burg (now Putao), is 340.

Once you receive the NDB signal, the radio direction will point towards the NDB. You can adjust the knob to switch from absolute to relative position.

For instance, if the aircraft's heading is 120, and you adjust the radio direction knob to 120, then the direction it points to is the NDB relative to your position.

> Nowadays, the number of NDBs is much lower than during World War II due to high maintenance costs and the availability of better alternatives like GPS.

## Landing

The landing roll distance of the DC-3 is quite short.

> Due to the slow engine response, if you find yourself too low during landing, you need to adjust the throttle early.

I want to write a longer article to document my hometown.

I am a true native of Emei, Leshan, Sichuan. Therefore, this article mainly talks about "Emei," with some supplementary information about Leshan.

Every year when I return, I can feel that some things have disappeared and been replaced.

## Geography

Locally, the administrative area known as "Emei City" is simply called "Emei." Leshan has three main train stations: Leshan Station, Emei Mountain Station, and Emei Station. Additionally, there is Yan Gang Station, but it is mainly used for freight.

The Tang monk passed through the Dadu River on his journey to the West. This Dadu River has a tributary called Linjiang. This river flows from east to west through the Emei Plain. Surrounding Linjiang is a town called "Linjiang Town." My hometown is in a place called "Taipingchang" in Linjiang Town.

Leshan has also been given a nickname by netizens: Los Angeles. I think it could also be called "California," as Leshan was historically known as Jiazhu (California).

## Culture

Emei has several major towns: Guihuaqiao Town, Jianong Town, Jiuli Town, and Suji Town.

Many administrative divisions of towns have undergone numerous changes, for example:

- Songwan, Liqiao Village, and Wangjia Village merged into Wangjia Village.
- Linjiang Town was merged into Pingxing Town (formerly Pingxing Township), but in the hearts of locals, Linjiang Town will always exist.
- Suji Yangwan was abolished.

## Cuisine

Linjiang Town is famous for its Linjiang eel strips. 

The most essential part is that after eating the eel strips, you must use the soup to eat noodles.

Tofu pudding is also a specialty of Leshan. You need to find tofu pudding.

## Dialect

The Emei dialect can be considered the most local branch of Leshan dialect. However, due to population movement, there aren't many specific characteristics in vocabulary. Here are some examples:

- Socks: wai er
- Next time: er hui or er tian
- End: pronounced as sai ge, for example, "Dinner sai ge le."
- Tidy up: sai ti
- Go: ji
- Horizontally: yue
- To describe a very foolish person: bai huo shi
- To describe someone who loves to show off: zan lin zi
- To describe geographical position: gao tou and xia tou, depending on the local perception of elevation
- You (your): niu
- Their: dou
- Our: ou

## Anecdotes

Here are some collected stories:

- Around 2005, a group of immigrants was relocated from Hanyuan County in Ya'an to build a hydropower station. These immigrants were settled in various towns in Leshan. In Linjiang Town, there is a street where Hanyuan immigrants live.
- There is a school in Linjiang Town that was donated by Yao Ming.
- Local people in Leshan only need to pay ten yuan to visit Emei Mountain, while outsiders need to pay 120 yuan.
- Leshan's public buses do not offer free rides for the elderly because many older people use them as a means of transportation.
- My grandfather, Lü Zhengtang, was once a well-known carpenter in the area but later fell seriously ill.

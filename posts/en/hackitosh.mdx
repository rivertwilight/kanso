**Able to enter BIOS**

**Can speak English or translate**

**Have hands and patience**

**Need a USB drive**

## **Introduction**

This article is suitable for beginners who have no knowledge of Hackintosh. If you have already purchased a computer and want to install Hackintosh, you can continue reading.

If you are preparing to buy a device that can run Hackintosh, you can refer to [laptops](https://github.com/daliansky/Hackintosh) and [desktops](https://macx.top/18202.html).

This article assumes you know how to use a VPN and GitHub.

## **Preliminary Search & Clarifying Configuration**

The general boot principle of Hackintosh is: modify the config and DSDT to boot OS X.

Clarifying the configuration will significantly reduce the number of drivers you need to search for later. All you need to do is search for "model + EFI."

If you find relevant information, you can jump directly to the installation section.

If your computer is hard to find or too niche, and you still want to install Hackintosh, you will need to configure EFI yourself.

**Configuring EFI**

This is a big point!

Please combine information from multiple sources.

Do not rely solely on this article, and do not limit yourself to domestic internet resources.

**Information You Need to Know**

Hackintosh is not very picky about USB drives, but if it's too old, too niche, or AMD, it's better to save time and not consider it. Netbooks (Pentium, Celeron) should be directly passed.

Intel integrated graphics (HD + some numbers) and most AMD discrete graphics can generally be driven; please search for "graphics card model + Hackintosh."

There are very few network cards that can be driven, and those that can be driven often require special methods. Please search for specific situations; this article will not elaborate.

The same goes for sound cards; please search for them yourself.

## **Downloading Work**

### *Must Download*

~~The files here~~ [reference](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/ktext.html#must-haves) ~~are essential software~~
Please remember their aliases (in parentheses).

***Please keep all your downloaded files together, and install the software. Make sure you can find everything!***

A plist editor for editing plist configurations: [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) or [OpenCoreCFG](https://mackie100projects.altervista.org/opencore-configurator/).

Essential, download the release of [Minimal EFI](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases).

[SSDT](https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime).

Disk utility (distinguishing tool) can be downloaded from Baidu.

[Lilu](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu/releases).

[VirtualSMC](https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC/releases).

[WhateverGreen! Some AMD integrated graphics cannot be installed!](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen/releases).

[AICP editing tool](https://acpica.org/downloads/binary-tools).

[Disk writing tool](https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/releases/download/v1.7.9/balenaEtcher-Setup-1.7.9.exe).

[Hackintosh Zone](https://blog.daliansky.net/) to download an image; you can message me for a copy.

These contain common issues encountered in Hackintosh; check here if you run into problems.

*Total of 10 files*

**This is an additional section for laptops; desktop users can skip this.**

~~Due to the presence of batteries, keyboards, and mice, most laptop users need to supplement these drivers. Of course, nothing is absolute; you cannot ensure that some will work without issues.~~

This section applies to most users. If this section does not work according to general tutorials, please search for the following content on Baidu:

**All laptop users**.

- SMCProcessor.kext
- SMCSuperIO.kext
- SMCLightSensor.kext
- SMCBatteryManager.kext
- SMCDellSensors.kext (for Dell users only)

*Total of 4 (5 for Dell)*

***AMD Users*** *need additional drivers*

[AMDProcessor](https://github.com/trulyspinach/SMCAMDProcessor).

[AMDRadeonGPU](https://github.com/aluveitie/RadeonSensor).

### **Graphics Card**

*Intel Integrated Graphics (meaning the computer has no discrete graphics)*

Use this [OC Toolbox](https://www.123pan.com/s/rd39-MkpOd) for convenience.

*Nvidia*

~~Only supports up to 10.13.6~~

[Reference](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1wr4y1r78X?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=b2ed1387674e77df3a3f4f6acfe5a846)
This part is controversial, and the technology is relatively new. Additionally, I do not have an Nvidia graphics card to test.

So Nvidia users should test it themselves.

*AMD Graphics (discrete graphics; if you have integrated graphics like Vega 8, you may need to wait or reverse engineer with C++).*

AMD graphics are either plug-and-play or require spoofing the ID.

At this point, AMD users can shout: AMD YES.

If you are a Vega 8 user and happen to know C++ and have experience with reverse engineering, feel free to contact me.

### **Sound Card**

For sound cards, different brands have different driver methods.

Some just require ID injection, some need additional drivers, and some cannot be driven at all.

I have found most sound card drivers available online; the rest you will need to test yourself.
[Sound Card](https://radcliffe.vercel.app/post/hei-ping-guo-sheng-qia-qu-dong/).

### **Network Card**

For Intel network cards, see [Intel](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/299695036).

[Other Network Cards](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/339648390).

Search for your network card model here.

If you find your network card, search for "model + Hackintosh."

**Now, all the downloading work should be done. You can take a short break; you've worked hard, but the real challenge is coming soon. Drink less, eat more.**

## **Configuring EFI**

Please follow this order or any order you won't mess up.

Please extract and install the downloaded files. If you see folders like XXX.kext, it means they are already minimal.

Please categorize the downloaded files.

### *Foundation*

Extract the "Minimal EFI" to a location you can find.

Delete everything in the Tools folder.

Keep only OpenRuntime.efi in the Drivers folder. "Please understand this sentence carefully!"

Put [this](https://github.com/acidanthera/OcBinaryData/blob/master/Drivers/HfsPlus.efi) in the Drivers folder.

### *ACIP*

~~The purpose of this step is to allow the system to control hardware, with software controlling hardware.~~

````[Reference](https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv10117507/)~~

1. Open the **SSDT** folder and run **SSDTTime.bat** inside.

2. In the order of "4, 3, 2" (the order cannot be wrong), it will generate 3 files.

3. Now we need to process **SSDT-RTC0.dsl**.

If it was not automatically generated, [download it](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/tree/master/Docs/AcpiSamples/Source/SSDT-RTC0.dsl).

Open it with a text editor and use all your knowledge to find:

```plain text
External (_SB_.PCI0.LPCB, DeviceObj)

Scope (_SB.PCI0.LPCB)
```

Modify it to:

```plain text
External (_SB_.PCI0.LPC, DeviceObj)

Scope (_SB.PCI0.LPC)
```

4. Process **SSDT-PMC**.
If it was not generated, [download it](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/tree/master/Docs/AcpiSamples/Source/SSDT-PMC.dsl).

```plain text
External (_SB_.PCI0.LPCB, DeviceObj)

Scope (_SB.PCI0.LPCB)
```

Change it to:

```plain text
External (_SB_.PCI0.LPC, DeviceObj)

Scope (_SB.PCI0.LPC)
```

5. Compile.
Use this command:

```plain text
acpihelp.exe -o filename
```

**Replace "filename" with the names of the 5 files you just generated.**
Finally, ensure you can see 5 files ending with XXX.aml.

6. Now, create a new folder, place the files inside, and name it "ACPI" to replace it in the "Minimal EFI" folder.

### *Configuring OpenCoreCFG*

[Please refer to this](https://post.smzdm.com/p/aqm8nxvx/); the author has written this part well, please check it out.

I will consider writing my own in the future.

### *Assembly*

Place the **kexts folder** and **ACPI** in the "Minimal EFI."

At this point, your "Minimal EFI" should have images 1.1 and 1.2.

![Image](/image/post/13b3032c-0204-4b35-9569-c515d16027a1_xS2aDI.png)

![Image](/image/post/8882f2b3-b890-4822-8333-db70fa06eb71_xS2hV0.png)

Rename your "Minimal EFI" to EFI.

```plain text
Take a break; you've made it this far.

Well done!

After this step, the official installation will begin.
```

## **Start Installation**

### 1. Write Disk

Use the "disk writing tool" to write the downloaded image to the USB drive.

~~If you get stuck at "Validating," just skip it.~~

For beginners: When you see both a green progress bar and the word "Skip," just click **skip**.

### 2. Enter BIOS

*Using all your knowledge, enter BIOS and disable (ignore what you don't have).*

```plain text
Fast Boot
Secure Boot
Serial/COM Port
Parallel Port
VT-d
CSM
Thunderbolt (some may not have drivers)
Intel SGX
Intel Platform Trust
CFG Lock (if possible)
```

*Enable*

```plain text
VT-x
Above 4G decoding
Hyper-Threading
Execute Disable Bit
EHCI/XHCI Hand-off
OS type: other
UEFI Mode
DVMT Pre-Allocated: 64MB
SATA Mode: AHCI
```

### 3. Boot Up

Boot from your USB drive.

### 4. Installation

First, set the installation program to a language you are familiar with; it’s best not to log in with an Apple ID.

If you find that the image you downloaded is in Russian and cannot find where to change it, please use translation software, I recommend *Google Translate*.

Second, if you are installing a system prior to Catalina (10.15.x), please [refer to this](https://www.applex.net/threads/macos-mojave.93508/).

### Aftermath

Now, if all goes well, you should be in the system.

Some network cards and sound cards may require additional operations; please follow the corresponding tutorials.

The injection part for the three codes is covered in the earlier *OpenCoreCFG* configuration section.

Another author has already mentioned it, so I won’t elaborate further.

## Conclusion

The article was written in a hurry, and I am not very familiar with some things. I hope everyone has the patience to work through it slowly.

Since Apple released the M1 chip, it’s uncertain how long Hackintosh will last. Let’s cherish it while we can.

If you are a Vega 8 user and happen to know C++ to write drivers, I can help you find progress abroad.

Thanks to all the developers who have silently contributed to Hackintosh!

Best regards,

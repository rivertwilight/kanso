This article showcases my personal skills and abilities as a supplement to my resume. Additionally, I am continuously learning, and this article will be updated regularly.

The article strives for authenticity and avoids fluff, serving solely as a supplement to my resume, with all content backed by evidence.

## Development

I have four years of experience in front-end development, with the majority of projects being open source. I am familiar with the React ecosystem, TypeScript, engineering practices, performance optimization, DevOps, and other related knowledge. I can quickly launch various products.

I possess strong learning abilities and a desire to learn, allowing me to rapidly develop unfamiliar products. The technology stack I am familiar with includes:

- Web front-end development based on ReactJS

I have one year of experience in Flutter development, with two apps developed using Flutter already available on the App Store. I am familiar with performance optimization, user experience design, debugging, and other processes.

I have two years of experience in Unity game development, with two independent game titles available on the App Store and Play Store.

I am familiar with basic back-end service development:

- Experience integrating BaaS services (Supabase & Firebase)
- Experience integrating payment systems (App Store)

I have a basic understanding of machine learning and can independently complete the development, operation, and testing of basic supervised learning models. I have written numerous study notes (including executable source code) published on GitHub.

My painting subjects primarily focus on landscapes and nature, employing various techniques, and I also engage in comic creation.

I can independently complete UI design and game prototype design, with a certain accumulation of design insights and skills.

My works are mainly published on my public account.

During the winter vacation, we built a replica of Yantai Development Zone Senior High School in Minecraft. On the day school started in September, I regrettably couldn't report for duty, so I consider this project a way to fulfill a dream through the game.

## 🎮 Save File Download and Installation

### 0. Importing the Map

Please use the Java version 1.12.2 Forge to enter the map.

After extracting the map, place it in the saves folder under the game root directory (e.g., `F:/Games/Minecraft/.minecraft`).

### 1. Installing Mods

This step cannot be skipped; otherwise, there will be a lot of missing blocks.

## ✨ Easter Eggs

### Civil Defense Project of the Senior High School

Under the farm, there is a large shelter that can accommodate all faculty and students for a month in case of a nuclear war. The entrance is located at a well in the farmland.

### Sewage System

The campus is equipped with a complete drainage system, boasting flood prevention capabilities comparable to that of the Amazon rainforest.

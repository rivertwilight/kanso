## App Store Materials

The App Store has strict requirements for materials, ensuring that the visual effects are professional and compliant.

### **App Screenshots**

- **Size**: Must adapt to various devices (e.g., iPhone 6.5 inches, iPad 12.9 inches), common resolutions are 1242×2688 (iPhone) or 2048×2732 (iPad).
- **Quantity**: Up to 10 for each device, at least 5 is recommended.
- **Design Points**:
  - Highlight the core features of the app, with each screenshot focusing on one feature.
  - Use clear text descriptions, with a moderate font size (recommended 24-36pt), avoiding excessive text.
  - Maintain consistent brand colors, with a simple background to avoid clutter.
  - Use **Shots** to add device frames for a more professional look.

### **Preview Video**

A 15-30 second video. It is recommended to capture user attention in the first 3 seconds by showcasing core features. Use dynamic text or animations to guide users in understanding the app's value. Avoid excessive effects to keep the visuals smooth.

### **In-App Purchase Icon**

- **Size**: 1024×1024 pixels, 1:1 ratio.
- **Design Points**:
  - Typically requires a badge (e.g., "New" or "Hot"), ensuring the badge style matches the icon.
  - Use high-contrast colors to ensure the icon remains clear at smaller sizes.

## Play Store Materials

Google Play has relatively relaxed material requirements, but visual appeal and brand consistency are still important. It is recommended to use **Figma** for designing materials and **Shots** for generating device frames.

### **App Screenshots**

- **Size**: Recommended 1080×1920 pixels (16:9), supporting various devices (e.g., phones, tablets).
- **Quantity**: 2-8 images, 5 is recommended.
- **Design Points**:
  - Each screenshot should highlight one feature, using concise text descriptions (recommended 18-24pt font).
  - Device frames or backgrounds can be added to enhance visual effects.
  - Ensure screenshots are clear across different screen sizes.

### **Feature Graphic**

- **Size**: 1024×500 pixels.
- **Design Points**:
  - Showcase the core value or brand image of the app.
  - Text should be concise, avoiding overly complex patterns.
  - Ensure the image remains attractive in small size previews.

### **Promotional Video**

- **Duration**: Under 30 seconds.
- **Format**: MP4, recommended 1080p.
- **Design Points**:
  - Quickly showcase the app's highlights to attract users to download.
  - Subtitles can be added for silent playback scenarios.

## Social Media Materials

Social media materials should be adjusted in size and style according to platform characteristics to maximize user engagement.

### Xiaohongshu

No strict limitations, recommended sizes are 3:4 (e.g., 1080×1440 pixels) or 1:1 (e.g., 1080×1080 pixels).

Avoid content that directs traffic, such as QR codes, links, etc.

### X

For personal homepage covers, a size of 1500×500 pixels is recommended, showcasing the brand image or latest products while keeping it simple. Avoid placing important content at the bottom of the image (as it may be obscured by the profile picture).

For tweet images, a size of 1200×675 pixels (16:9) or 1080×1080 pixels (1:1) is recommended.

## General Tips

- **Brand Consistency**: All materials should use a unified color scheme, fonts, and logos to ensure brand recognition.
- **Copyright Compliance**: Use licensed fonts, images, and materials to avoid infringement risks.
- **Multilingual Support**: If targeting a global market, prepare multilingual versions of text descriptions and materials.

One evening, I had a sudden thought and wanted to look up what true friendship really looks like.

I came across various answers from both domestic and international sources.

Some say it is "making an effort to stay in your life";

Some say it is "being there when you need them";

Some say it is "taking your difficulties as their own";

...

But the metaphor I agree with the most is “**Even if we haven't seen each other for three autumns, it feels like just a day apart**.” Thinking back, it's almost time for the high school entrance exam, and it's been two years since I left my best buddy in Yantai. At that time, I didn't pay much attention to the concept of "friendship," and interacting with everyone felt more relaxed and natural, without worrying about whether the relationship would fade.

Now, perhaps influenced by those around me, I have gradually started to consciously define "friends" and "acquaintances," which has made life feel more burdensome. I still believe that going with the flow is the best approach.

As for friendships with the opposite sex, it should be even more natural. Drawing a red line, where everyone feels comfortable outside of it, is enough; there's no need to schedule "contact." If feelings develop for a friend of the opposite sex, I remind myself of that red line.

Finally, here’s a response I found on Zhihu:

> I used to think that friendship meant being able to talk about anything, without barriers caused by time or distance, and that both parties relied on each other for support and security. But now I realize that in reality, friendship can involve periods where you may ignore each other, or even feel annoyed by each other, finding each other's flaws hard to tolerate. However, through gradual adjustment and learning to accept each other's shortcomings, you can still remain friends. Even after experiencing various grievances, you never give up on each other. I truly believe that **between long-term friends, there are not only beautiful moments but also many unpleasant memories; it is these unpleasant experiences that make the friendship even more precious.**

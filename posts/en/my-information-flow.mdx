A few days ago, I found that my Yuque account was banned for no reason. Interestingly, it showed that it was reported by users.

This brings me to why I use Yuque: primarily **to manage my article bookmarks**. When I come across a good article online, if I click the bookmark button on the platform, it’s very likely that I won’t see it again. Moreover, **if the article gets deleted one day, I won’t be able to access it**.

So I chose to use **JianYue** to create copies of articles and save them to Yuque for permanent storage and organized classification.

JianYue is a browser extension that not only provides an immersive reading experience but also allows you to save articles to major knowledge management services like Notion, Instapaper, Pocket, etc. This is a crucial step; **it’s essential to maintain ownership of information as much as possible**.

After my account was banned, I began to reassess this domestic tool:

🙃 It creates information silos; the document import features are rich, but the export features are quite limited.

🙃 Privacy is not secure (there is a review process).

🙃 It is quite bloated; I only need about 30% of its features.

🙃 The extensibility is weak, and the API has a high usage threshold.

Thus, I decided to use GitHub to manage my articles, which almost resolved all my pain points, and JianYue also supports direct saving to GitHub. With the natural advantages of pure files, I can customize pages using tools like Docusaurus to enhance the reading experience. In the future, I can also write programs to implement flomo's "Daily Review" feature.

So my information management workflow has transformed into this:

For articles read on my phone, I need to open the link in a computer browser and then execute the above steps.

With the help of some document generation tools, the reading effect can be improved:

Docusaurus

At the same time, open-source software also ensures the security and reliability of information.

When choosing software, avoid information silos and focus on extensibility. In an era of fragmented information, it is essential to have the ability to discern and think critically, as well as the ability to manage information. **Next time you come across an article you like, try to save it properly.**

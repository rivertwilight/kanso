When I first started learning, I was somewhat confused by problems like "rotate a certain curve around the $ x $ axis." This article will provide a detailed explanation with illustrations to clarify this issue for readers.

Such problems may require finding the surface equations formed by rotating parabolas or hyperbolas around a certain axis.

When a curve rotates around the x-axis, the $ y $ and $ z $ coordinates of each point will form the equation of a circle, with a radius equal to the absolute value of the original $ y $ coordinate. In other words:

$
y^2 + z^2 = r^2
$

How do we determine $ r $? Since the curve lies in the $ xOy $ plane, the $ y $ value of any point on the curve at the start of the rotation is the radius. Thus, we have:

$
y\_1^2 + z\_1^2 = y^2
$

Therefore, we only need to replace $ y $ in the curve with $ y^2 + z^2 $ to derive the new surface equation.

Similarly, when rotating around the y-axis, the value of $ x $ is the radius, so we have:

$
y\_1^2 + z\_1^2 = x^2
$

Note that it is important to identify which plane the curve is located in before determining the radius. For curves in the $ xOz $ plane, the replacement equation is slightly different. This will not be demonstrated here:

- Rotating around the $ x $ axis: $ z^2 = z^2 + y^2 $
- Rotating around the $ y $ axis: $ x^2 = x^2 + z^2 $
- Rotating around the $ z $ axis: $ x^2 = x^2 + y^2 $

This image demonstrates the rotation of a parabola in the $ xOy $ plane around the x-axis by 180 degrees. The right side shows the front view, and it is easy to see:

$
r^2 = y^2 = 4
$

To make it easier to remember the value of $ r $, you can understand it this way: **To choose one of the three values $ x, y, z $ as $ r $, simply remove the coordinate axis around which you are rotating, and then select the intersection of the remaining two values with the two values of the plane.**

For example, if a curve in the $ xOy $ plane rotates around the $ x $ axis, you remove the x-axis, leaving y and z. Then, find the intersection of y and z with x and y to determine that $ r $ is $ y $.

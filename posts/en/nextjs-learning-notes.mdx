## Deployment

### Deployment Method

Similar to Express, after compilation, run the `npm run start` command, and configure the server for reverse proxy.

### Port Occupation

By default, Next.js uses port 3000 in the development environment. If you execute the `npm run start` command at this time, it will prompt that the port is occupied. You can change the start command in the `package.json` file as follows:

```cli
npm run start -p <port>
```

## i18n Feature Does Not Support Static Export

Unfortunately, it can only be hosted on a server.

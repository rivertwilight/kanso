This article introduces the cold start procedure for the A320 and A320neo, as well as flying techniques.

This is not a checklist, but rather a beginner-friendly operational guide.

## Flight Plan

If you don't want to spend money on a subscription

## Cold Start & Taxiing

1. Start the external power

## Takeoff

## Cruise

During cruise, the aircraft is usually in autopilot mode. The captain

## Landing

When you see the white descent arrow on the ND, it's time to begin your descent.

This white arrow in MSFS may not be accurate; it indicates the recommended idle descent point, meaning the aircraft should start gliding with the engines at IDLE from this point. It is advisable to estimate mentally: for every 1000 meters of descent, glide approximately 3000 meters.

## ATC

This section explains how to interact with ground and air traffic controllers.

First, during a complete flight, you will encounter the following types of ATC:

- Tower: This is the high tower you see at the airport, where the tower controllers are located. They are responsible for directing aircraft for takeoff, landing, taxiing, etc.
- Ground: They also sit in the tower and are responsible for directing aircraft during taxiing and parking.
- Approach: Located in the Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) or in the control room/office building below the tower.
- Center: For example, when flying from Chengdu to Hangzhou, you will pass through the Chengdu control area, Wuhan control area, Nanchang control area, and Hangzhou control area. Each control area has its own controllers, who also work in closed radar rooms, usually located in large independent buildings under the air traffic control bureau. A center control facility may be responsible for aircraft across multiple provinces or large airspaces.

## Emergency Procedures

Since the Airbus series is fly-by-wire, the captain actually plays more of a "supervisor" role. This is the biggest difference compared to the Boeing series.

### Manual Landing

When you decide to land manually, you need to follow these steps:

### Engine Shutdown

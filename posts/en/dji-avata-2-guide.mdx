## Preparation Before Takeoff

1. Go to UOM to register an account and complete real-name verification (only needs to be verified once).
2. Register your drone on UOM (only needs to be registered once).
3. Fully charge the controller, drone, and goggles.
4. Report your flight on the DJI FLY flight map, including takeoff location, flight radius, flight altitude, etc. Some areas can be approved in one second, while others may require applications a few days in advance.

## Flight Guide

### Basic Flight

There are two flight modes for basic flying.

### Indoor Takeoff

Before attempting this type of flight, please ensure you have mastered basic flying in N mode and S mode.

### Night Flight

Before attempting night flight, ensure that:

- You are familiar with the area you will be flying in.
- The weather is calm with no wind or rain.

## Is It Worth Buying?

I think the Avata 2 is a very interesting "toy." Its compact size and ease of use allow you to discover the world from a unique perspective.

If you are looking for a simple and fun recreational activity on weekends, rather than being stuck on a screen scrolling through your phone or playing games, then it is worth a try.

Additionally, DJI offers many purchasing options.

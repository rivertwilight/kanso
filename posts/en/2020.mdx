## Books Read

I read more than 20 books, all on Kindle.

Over the year, I read a lot and learned a lot; knowledge gained from books is ultimately shallow. To truly understand, one must practice.

- "The Devotion of Suspect X"
- "The Convenience Store of Worries" - Warm.
- "The Three-Body Problem"
- "The Time of My Life"
- "Malice" - Experiencing the various aspects of life
- "Norwegian Wood"
- "The Power of Now" - There is not a moment in life that is not in the present.
- "The Brothers" - In the chaos of the world, one must keep their true self. China has taken forty years to cover the path that the West took in four hundred years.
- "The Sayings of Cai Gen" - The path of self-cultivation is long.
- "Kafka on the Shore"
- "A Wild Sheep Chase"
- Several issues of "The Economist"
- Several issues of "The New Yorker"
- "The Pragmatic Programmer" - Becoming an excellent programmer is really not easy; there is so much to learn.
- "The Death of a Loved One" - A generation's love elegy.

And other scattered articles.

## Favorite Songs

- "Not Looking Anymore" - I hope you don't meet someone like me again. Sensitive, lacking love, often overthinking, always bothering you to chat with me. It must be tiring for you, but I still hope you meet someone like that because such a person really loves you a lot!

- "Rainy Day" - What to do on a rainy day? I really miss you.

- "Like the Wind" - Those who cannot be kept have the wind hidden in their blood.

- "Preserve" - I only think about it at night. Did I really like her that much? Why do I feel upset when she ignores me? When I try to ignore her on purpose, I still feel upset. What about her?

## Insights

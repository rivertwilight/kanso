## Reading

### "The Devotion of Suspect X"

"My life is like walking in the white night."

Crossing over a timeline of more than twenty years is shocking. After finishing the book, I realized that every plot point subtly or directly depicts the love between Yukari and Ryoji. Ryoji, as Yukari's "sun in the white night," protects her until the very last moment.

### "The Miracles of the Namiya General Store"

A very warm and healing story. The four parts seem unrelated but are tightly interwoven. It is a mystery novel, yet there are no suspects, no police, just a few ordinary people telling ordinary stories.

### "The Three-Body Problem"

"Give civilization to time, not time to civilization."
I was completely shocked by the vast and complex worldview after reading it; the sky seemed to become even more mysterious.

### "Time"

Although it is a somewhat cliché time-travel theme, the familial love is enough to make up for this shortcoming. The reasoning aspect of the Chizuru storyline is relatively weak.

### "Norwegian Wood"

Compared to Naoko, I prefer Midori, who is cheerful and lively, full of life. ~~She is the ideal girlfriend!~~

Perhaps I am still young, and reading it now feels a bit naive. Maybe in a few years, when I reach Watanabe's age, I will be able to understand what true love is.

### "The Devotion of Suspect X"

A duel between geniuses, with meticulous reasoning, the entire text is engaging and flows seamlessly. Similar to "The Devotion of Suspect X," it is also a story about a man who pays a huge price to protect the one he loves. I feel that Shikigami's failure is largely due to not controlling his facial expressions well, which led to Yukawa discovering his connection with Yasuko.

### "Willpower"

The works of two Japanese authors, Keigo Higashino and Haruki Murakami, beautifully showcase the social landscape of Japan in the 1960s and 70s ("Norwegian Wood," "Time") and before the economic bubble ("The Devotion of Suspect X").

Additionally, I have not finished reading "The Programmer's Path" and "The Power of Now."

## Film and Television

### "Identity"

An excellent suspense film, slightly terrifying, with an ending that is truly unexpected.

### "Shutter Island"

Same as above.

### "A Certain Scientific Railgun T"

"The electric light dancing at your fingertips is my unchanging faith, for my railgun to last forever!"

I have nothing more to say; first, let's celebrate that Railgun T has surpassed 130 million views. Love the Railgun!

### "Criminal Minds Season 9" Episodes 1-15

## Development

Overall, the focus is still on development, with learning as a supplement. I improved the [blog system](https://blog.yungeeker.com) and continued developing the [YunGeek Tool](https://www.ygktool.cn).

Promotions are not just about discounts; they are a sales strategy in themselves.

This article compiles some simple, actionable promotional methods, along with feasible suggestions based on personal experience. It will be updated regularly.

## Invite Friends for Membership

This is one of the most powerful growth methods. Its essence is in its ability to create a viral effect, which is one of the core strategies of viral marketing.

Typically, both the inviter and the invitee can benefit in some way.

## Discounts on Special Dates

Limited-time offers and promotional events can create a sense of urgency and scarcity, prompting consumers to make quick purchasing decisions. Currently popular special dates include:

- Black Friday
- Christmas
- Product launch anniversaries
- A period after product updates

## Sharing / Triple Rewards

## Free Access

If your product offers in-app purchases on the App Store, you can set a pricing plan to adjust it to $0. At that time, various resource, benefit websites, and media outlets will take notice of your product (as they typically crawl App Store pricing information regularly), and you can also gain free backlinks.

## Special Discounts for Specific Groups

You can offer special discounts for students, teachers, and other specific groups.

While the current LTV (Lifetime Value) of students may not be high, they are the most potential group where word-of-mouth can flourish.

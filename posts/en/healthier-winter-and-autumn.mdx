## Introduction

With the end of the hot summer days and the arrival of cooler weather, have you experienced the following symptoms:

- Cold hands and feet
- Frequent sneezing
- Recurrence of rhinitis
- Unformed stools
- Low mood
- …

Some readers may have biases against "health preservation" and "traditional Chinese medicine." This is often influenced by Western medicine or a lack of personal experience. After all, a culture that has lasted for thousands of years would not have survived if it were merely talk. Readers have the opportunity to personally try both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine to experience the different feelings brought by Eastern and Western cultures.

Everything in the world follows certain laws of operation, but since modern times, technological development has been rapid, and many new things have emerged, which contradicts the slow development of nature.

Human genes are largely defenseless against modern phenomena, such as air conditioning in summer, food additives, and artificial light after sunset. Our ancestors did not experience the elimination caused by excessive air conditioning, intake of food additives, or staying up late. Therefore, the health preservation that ancient Chinese people valued is even more important today.

## Summary

If you don't have time to read the entire article, remember the following key points:

- Exercise to the point of slight sweating
- Sleep before eleven o'clock
- Soak your feet regularly
- Ensure ample sunlight and actively participate in social activities
- Avoid excessive indulgence

## 🥶 Cool Down Your Body

Traditional Chinese medicine believes that autumn is the season of "harvest," while winter is the season of "storage." During autumn and winter, sweat and semen should not be released excessively to allow for growth in the coming year. Therefore, exercise should focus on slight sweating rather than excessive sweating, and you can appropriately increase rest intervals during workouts or engage in lower-intensity training.

Among the four seasons, only summer requires **ample** sweating.

If you experience unformed stools after the weather cools down, it is likely due to insufficient yang energy in your body. Comparing the process of digesting food to cooking porridge, yang energy is like the fire that boils water. If the fire is insufficient, good porridge cannot be made.

There is a saying in folk wisdom: "Spring wraps and autumn freezes." Ancient wisdom is often very effective; the principle is that indoor temperatures are usually higher than outside. If you add clothes too early when entering a warm room, it can lead to sweating and harm yang energy. However, this should also be based on individual constitution, as it is not suitable for everyone.

However, one part of the body that should not be "cooled" is your feet. In fact, soaking your feet is a very good health-preserving method regardless of the season. There are many meridians in the feet, often referred to as the "second heart."

## 🌙 Sleep Early

Perhaps countless people have advised you to sleep early, but I must reiterate this point.

In autumn, the energy of heaven and earth converges, and the human body should also converge, hence the advice to **sleep early and rise early**. In winter, it is encouraged to **sleep early and rise late.** Observant readers may have noticed that this actually changes with the length of day and night.

You may have experienced this: feeling sleepy before eleven o'clock, but after staying up past eleven, you feel more awake. This is actually consuming energy for the next day in advance.

There is a saying: as long as you stay up late for a long time, it is not considered staying up late; it is merely changing your routine. In fact, the organs in the body have their own operating rhythms, just like nature, and will not change with your subjective alteration of your routine.

Some readers may encounter this situation: even though they sleep sufficiently, they still feel tired during the day. Possible reasons include:

- Chronic, consuming diseases
- Sleeping too late, going to bed in the middle of the night, which goes against the body's operating rhythm
- Poor sleep quality, frequent dreaming, easily waking up, or simply feeling that sleep is very shallow
- Neurasthenia
- If it is summer, it may also be due to excessive dampness, leading to a "heavy head," in which case you can consume foods that dispel dampness, such as yam and poria.

People often become reluctant to exercise in winter, and with shorter days and longer nights, it is easy to stay in bed.

An effective tip is to turn off electronic devices in advance, so the brain is not exposed to new stimuli and blue light.

## 😐 What to Eat Tomorrow?

Human constitution varies between cold and hot, and foods also have cold and hot properties. For autumn, it is advisable to eat less cold and cool food.

Note that you must eat **seasonal foods.** Seasonal fruits in autumn include hawthorn, persimmons, apples, and pears.

If you have a weak constitution and are afraid of the cold, you can drink water boiled with perilla leaves or soak them in water. This helps to dispel cold and induce sweating, commonly used for wind-cold colds (not suitable for qi deficiency or warm conditions), but it should be used in moderation and not for long periods.

## 😊 Stay Happy

If Du Fu climbed high in spring, he might not have written the timeless verse "Endless falling leaves rustle down, the Yangtze River rolls on endlessly." 

Autumn and winter have historically been seasons of parting, and many melancholic poems originate from these times.

Of course, if your low mood is severe, you may need to consider Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), a condition that is more common in temperate and cold regions, usually manifesting as depression in winter.

I live in Sichuan, where we often go days without seeing the sun in winter, so I remind everyone to remember to **get some sunlight** and connect with friends. Sunbathing is also an effective therapy for SAD.

## On Modern Indulgence

No, I am not getting off-topic; this is actually closely related to your health, especially in autumn and winter.

As mentioned in the introduction, modern indulgence has flourished with the rise of the internet. Similarly, our ancestors did not experience the elimination caused by excessive reproduction, leading us to feel lost in an era of rampant indulgence. The amount of (soft) pornographic information you encounter in a day may not compare to what ancient people experienced in a lifetime.

The physical consumption brought by indulgence is enormous. It cannot be denied that sexual desire is a sign of physical health, but when ancient needs confront the spread of modern indulgence, can we protect our health?

Autumn and winter are seasons of storage; if there is excessive release in winter, it can lead to a lack of vitality in spring. Therefore, excessive indulgence is not advisable.

## ✍️ Conclusion

You may feel that following various health preservation suggestions is akin to being sent off to become a monk. In fact, a significant reason is that the effects of health preservation require time to validate. As long as you persist over the long term, you will surely reap the benefits; I believe some readers have experienced this.

Similarly, modern society has many chronic diseases, and the cutting down of the tree of life is also gradual.

Since I have a naturally weak constitution, I have been paying attention to health and wellness since high school. Many young people like to make full use of their youthful bodies, unaware that they are like frogs in warm water, exhausting their future vitality.

I hope everyone will soon pay attention to their health, truly integrate their bodies into nature, go with the flow, and lay a solid foundation for achieving their dreams.

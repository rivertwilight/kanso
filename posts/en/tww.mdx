How to choose between the one who loves you and the one you love? This is truly an age-old dilemma.

When you are young, you will definitely choose the one you love. It's like when you're young, how to choose between a soulmate and a life partner; you would undoubtedly choose the soulmate, not wanting a life partner. But one day, when you are no longer that young, you finally understand that finding a life partner is not necessarily easier than finding a soulmate, and it might even be harder.

The one who loves you, you may not love that much, or even not at all; but you shouldn't hate them.

The one you love, they may love you, or they may not; even if they do love you, it may not be as much as you love them.

If one is the one who loves you and the other is the one you love, if you cannot love the one who loves you, then do not be afraid of disappointment and hurt; go ahead and love the one you love.

If there is no one you love, then try to love the one who loves you. If you can't do that, then just keep waiting, or choose to live alone.

Wang Never Grows Up:

Hahaha help, you who never grow up, how can you say I'm five years old? Hehe.

Wow, your birthday is here so quickly, happy birthday, little brother!

I’m very lucky to have met you; I have “the flower in the box of eyes” (but it got my glasses cloth dirty! AA).

I have someone who can see my little world (but really, don’t look too closely, ah!).

I have a desk mate who talks non-stop every day; I don’t even have time to be depressed, haha.

> Note: There’s a small line here reminding: but you still need to pay attention in class!

You really are a senior VIP on NetEase Cloud, haha help, that’s too deadly -> really bad luck, someone has complained to me that if your fashion sense was better, maybe someone would cherish you (key point!!!

But for all that has passed, I am really grateful for you and cherish you.

Like a little kid with messy hair, haha.

And stop nitpicking the details every day, ugh! I’m going to be speechless!

Also, I really treat you two sincerely, ah, I consider you a true friend. The “growing old together” we mistakenly drew might just mean our friendship can last forever! : -)

> Bottom right corner addition: As long as you’re not so cowardly, ah ah ah, haha.

- No matter how old.
- Always love.
- Heroes and magic. ♡

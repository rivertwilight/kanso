This year has been quite exciting, so as usual, I will write an end-of-year summary.

## Academics

This year started with the tail end of the pandemic, and my studies faced some setbacks, resulting in failing a few courses (the kind that requires retaking).

However, I still advanced to my sophomore year, gradually distancing myself from various trivial matters at school, completely rejecting the "Youth University Study" program, and focusing on my own pursuits.

## Creation & Learning

I dedicated a stable amount of energy to learning foreign languages. I didn't miss a day on Duolingo, did some exercises in French and Japanese, and almost brushed Anki cards daily.

I maintained my writing habit, publishing 16 articles in 2023 on my public account and personal blog, covering topics such as health, programming, and languages.

I went from having no knowledge of Blender to being able to create simple models.

I gradually formed my own insights in design. I designed over 30 pages on Figma, created 3 app icons, and a company logo.

I learned Flutter from scratch to the point where I can freely design and develop apps, launching 2 apps and a game.

I developed the company website from scratch, solidifying my existing front-end tech stack.

I started learning machine learning from zero, and after a few weeks, I can understand papers and plan and create models.

## Relationships

I gained clarity about some people around me.

I was fortunate to meet someone who shares my values and whom I want to care for a lifetime.

## Health

My health is steadily improving; my dental condition has improved, and my vision has stabilized. I still maintain the habit of walking.

I learned to play table tennis and can manage a few rallies now.

My lumbar and shoulder conditions are not great, probably due to accumulated fatigue.

(There's one more thing I'm not sure where to put: does completing the Apple ecosystem count as part of the summary?)

## Looking Ahead

I accomplished many things in 2023. I deeply felt the power behind the saying, "There are few things you can do in a day, but many things you can do in a year."

The next step is to learn shaders, Blender shortcuts, and create more complex models.

I already have a new product in the planning stage, with the internal theme being "Do the small things well." I will focus on the iOS ecosystem and aim to release it in 2024. Additionally, I want to truly establish the company; not to mention salaries, at least I should earn back the startup costs, right?

In the realm of front-end development, I will continue to solidify my foundation and prepare for potential interviews. Of course, the best scenario is not having to work for someone else.

I aim to pass the N2 exam and improve in the other languages I am learning.

I also want to create more memories with her.

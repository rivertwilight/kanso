> The heartfelt conversations at the beginning have turned into monotony.

Those who have seen through it yet remain deeply trapped are the most pitiful. Finally, you and I have gradually lost our connection. Recently, I read a status on social media: "Today is the first day back to work in the new year, and everyone wrote the date as January 4, 2020, in the temperature log at the entrance of the company." This is a strange inertia, like sitting in a speeding car that suddenly brakes, and the body can't help but lurch forward. Having gotten used to 2020, it's really hard to suddenly adapt to 2021. Maintaining a state for too long, without any buffer, makes it impossible to stop; it's the same with affection. When one person occupies another's past, present, and even future, brutally taking over their emotions, body, and spirit, even causing a rose that never wilts to bloom in that person's heart. No one can suddenly quit the habit of "always liking" someone, nor can anyone cruelly uproot all memories and evidence of that affection.

I know that giving up is hard, so today I still love you, and I will wait until tomorrow to give up.

Perhaps our relationship isn't that selfless; there has been affection, and there has been resentment. There have been moments of cleverness, as well as moments of genuinely wanting the best for each other. There have been grievances, and there have been happy times. There have been sad moments, and countless times I wanted to leave. But after experiencing all of this, I still want to get closer to you. My affection for you still outweighs my dislike for you, just a little bit.

In fact, you never really liked me, did you?

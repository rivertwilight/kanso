This article compiles some books I read between the ages of 17 and 19. It does not provide specific recommendations, but serves as a reference.

I will write whatever comes to mind, and the order has no real significance.

## Behind the Product

This book is written by a former product manager at NetEase Cloud Music. From the perspective of a product manager, it provides a detailed analysis of how to discover and analyze needs, as well as how to design products. Additionally, it covers knowledge in areas such as operations, product performance analysis, and UX design.

> Roles, scenarios, and processes are a classic method for requirement analysis. The key lies in breaking down a requirement from three angles, carefully savoring the true user psychology, usage scenarios, and processes hidden behind a seemingly correct requirement, thus judging the authenticity and effectiveness of the requirement and deciding whether we should implement it.

## Introduction to Deep Learning

This book is written by Japanese scholar Yoshiyuki Saito, and there are currently four books in this series. The fifth book is also on the way, and the author is one of the reviewers.

The text is easy to understand, richly illustrated, and after reading it, one can grasp most of the basic concepts in deep learning and gain the ability to read related papers.

No programming background is required to read this book. It is recommended to follow the code in the book to develop an identical project, carefully understanding the meaning of each line of code. During my reading and practice, I organized a configurable and runnable Jupyter Notebook, which readers can preview online in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RiverTwilight/Awesome-Machine-Learning-Playground).

## Minimalist Entrepreneur

The author of this book is an entrepreneur who created Gurmond, an asset trading website abroad. In this book, he presents best practices for creating a SaaS company at low cost and offers many valuable insights for entrepreneurs.

At the end of the book, the author emphasizes what he believes is the most important point in entrepreneurship: to start.

## Refactoring UI

This book is written by the founder of Tailwind. It is easy to understand and introduces common techniques and pitfalls in UI design, covering a wide range of scenarios.

Much of the content can be easily applied in practice, and after reading it, I effectively improved my UI design skills. The difference between good design and poor design often lies in just a few pixels.

## Design in Design

The author, Kenya Hara, designed a new logo for Xiaomi Group. This book is a summary of his years of design experience. Combining excellent design cases from various Japanese designers, the book does not discuss practical design techniques but approaches from the perspective of design philosophy. The author points out that the essence of design is to convey information.

> "In the media field, designers play a role similar to that of doctors; what they do is solve problems through information transmission."

## No Interface Interaction

The author of this book emphasizes the concept that modern people have fallen into an "interface trap." With the development of the internet and mobile devices, people often tend to direct solutions to any problem towards a screen. However, in many cases, the best solution is to have no screen at all.

The author also stresses that UI and UX should not be conflated; UX itself is a discipline.

For example, a car company once designed an app to open the car's trunk. However, what people really want is to open the trunk when their hands are full, and using a foot to swipe under the car is undoubtedly a better solution.

## You Are What You Eat

The author, Xia Meng, experienced a serious illness but recovered through a scientific diet.

This book covers a series of practical nutritional meal plans, including daily food type combinations, calculations of various nutrient intake, and more.

The author points out that modern diets are very different from those of our ancestors, but our genes have not evolved to the point where they can handle refined rice, refined flour, and additives.

## Steppenwolf

This novel by German literary master Hermann Hesse tells the strange story of a character named Steppenwolf.

After reading it, I felt that I was the Steppenwolf described in the book.

## Educated: A Memoir

This is the autobiography of Tara Westover, detailing how the author changed her fate through education. I personally consider it a "down-to-earth" inspirational book that also prompts reflection on the power of education.

It is worth mentioning that the Chinese title of this book was chosen by the author, while the English title is "Educated: A Memoir."

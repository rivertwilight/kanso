Agatha Christie's classic mystery novel "And Then There Were None" is a pinnacle work in the history of detective fiction.

Ten strangers are invited to Indian Island, only to find themselves caught in a meticulously designed game of death. As the nursery rhyme's predictions come true one by one, the people on the island begin to die, and a terrifying atmosphere envelops everyone.

This novel has become a classic of detective fiction due to its clever plot, tense atmosphere, and unexpected ending. Christie uses the setting of this enclosed space to showcase the complexity of human nature and the cost of evil.

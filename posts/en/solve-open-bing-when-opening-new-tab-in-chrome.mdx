## Background of the Issue

When setting Chrome's search engine to Bing, if you are in the habit of opening a new tab and immediately typing in the address bar, the address bar gets cleared again after the page loads! It's really frustrating.

## Solution

Use a custom Bing engine. Go to `Settings -> Manage Search Engines -> Add`, and you can write anything for the name and keyword. For the query URL, enter `https://cn.bing.com/search?q=%s`!

## About Bing

For programmers behind the Great Firewall who cannot access the internet freely, using Bing instead of Google is a good choice.

What? You say to use Baidu? Be careful of dimensionality reduction attacks!

I am an "introverted creator" and a "deep worker." This group faces a problem: the creation of value and the dissemination of value are two completely different abilities, and society often over-rewards the latter.

This article shares my thoughts on this topic.

## Context Collapse

Let me start with a side note.

I rarely share my life within my circle of acquaintances, but I have fewer reservations in front of strangers. This is because, in familiar circles, everything often starts from "value judgment" rather than simple information exchange.

Another reason is the phenomenon of "Context Collapse." This is the essential difference between Twitter, social circles, and blogs. Your boss, your relatives, your clients, your old classmates... everyone is crowded in this square watching your performance. You cannot say the same sincere words to everyone, so you can only choose to say the safest, most correct, and also the most boring things.

This makes it difficult for you to face your true self and find your pure qualities; instead, you are constantly thinking about performing.

I have always believed that the recognition of someone who truly understands your product design aesthetics is worth far more than 1,000 irrelevant likes. As Dieter Rams said: good design is honest. There is no need for excessive embellishment.

## Acknowledged Facts

In an age of information explosion, even good wine fears a deep alley. A loud, continuously broadcasting voice is easier to be discovered than someone quietly polishing a masterpiece in the corner. Attention itself has become the most scarce resource.

If you show your truest self, what you present is often difficult to spread. This is due to visibility winning: in many cases, people (especially managers, investors, and the public) do not have the time or ability to deeply assess the "hardcore value" of your work. They will take shortcuts—looking at whether you are confident, whether your expression is smooth, and whether your story is persuasive. Your "broadcasting ability" is treated as a proxy indicator of your "intrinsic value."

So in the past, I have seen some "entrepreneurs" with prestigious school backgrounds, elite education, polished PPTs, grand narratives, and fluent speeches, but what they are pursuing is actually the "success" influenced by exam-oriented education. The exam paper is no longer physical; they do not exist to create but to respond to certain social expectations.

There are also some people I call "barefoot doctors." Their characteristics are noise; they use various means to attract attention, and their ultimate goal is ephemeral attention and money.

## Becoming a Lighthouse

Social media is not a neutral tool: it was designed from the beginning to hijack people's attention, making them spend more time on the platform. But you can choose: let it become your megaphone, and your work is your museum. Your goal is to throw out a bit of gold in this noisy world.

Ultimately, what can truly take you far is not the story you tell, but how much substance is in your story.

When you write sincerely for yourself, it is easier to attract like-minded readers; works that do not seek to be seen often have more vitality.

The world may be temporarily noisy, but it will ultimately reward those who can create lasting value. Stay patient and keep building.

This year felt both long and short. The biggest feature was that I switched my base location three times in a year.

In January, I was still in Chengdu, in February I moved to Shanghai, and by July, I was in Hangzhou.

## Work

This year, I escaped from ByteDance and joined [LobeHub](https://github.com/lobehub). It wasn't really an act of courage, as I felt like a caged bird at ByteDance; leaving brought me freedom.

> So here I am in Hangzhou, often found in coffee shops. Feel free to come and hang out with me.

## Creation

I have had a slight change in what I want to do. My goal is no longer to "make a lot of money," but rather to "become a craftsman."

### FlowFerry

This year, [FlowFerry](https://www.ygeeker.com/flowferry) has given me quite a return, allowing me to earn several times the cost of coffee each month.

In fact, I am still far from my ideal state. I wrote an article titled “[Insights from Five Years of Product Creation](/p/en/tips-for-creating-stuff)” about making these products; feel free to check it out if you're interested.

### Mono Card

This is a project where I invested a lot of love and effort.

### Hackathon Awards Again

I participated in the AdventureX hackathon again this year and won two third-place awards. However, due to various events this year, I have lost much interest in this competition and will likely not participate again next year.

### detail.design

[Detail](https://detail.design) is the most exciting project for me this year; I tried producing content for the first time. At the end of the year, I introduced it in a small circle, and the response was good, even getting featured in the DEX Weekly.

On October 13th last year, I purchased the domain drawl.ink, which is the predecessor of Mono Card.

I will intentionally slow down the expansion of my product line; at this rate, adding one new product a year is quite good.

Starting from this article, I will encourage myself to increase my update frequency and use human-centered content to combat the AI-polluted internet.

## Life

This year, I was particularly reluctant to share my life (though I didn't share much in previous years either). I think I only posted one cat photo on social media this year.

When I share my work, I am actually sharing my life. My lifestyle shapes my creations.

We welcomed a new family member, "Curry," a lovely golden retriever.

In the second half of the year, I really enjoyed two books: "Amusing Ourselves to Death" and "Brave New World." Everything in life has become entertainment, even love is turned into a variety show on screen. Yet even so, dating shows are fake and scripted.

So sometimes I wonder if I am a cynic: feeling that this world is hypocritical, absurd, and full of falsehoods. But I can also be easily moved by beautiful things.

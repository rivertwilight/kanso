Dear Teacher and Classmates,

I was one minute late to last week's "Career Planning Course," and I sincerely apologize for this. I recognize the inappropriateness of my behavior and feel deeply guilty. I would like to write down my reflection here, hoping to gain the understanding of my teacher and classmates.

First of all, I must admit my mistake. Arriving late to class is not only disrespectful to the teacher and classmates but also shows a lack of responsibility on my part. My behavior caused inconvenience to everyone and even affected the smooth progress of the class. I feel remorseful and guilty, and I will strive to correct this bad habit.

One minute can be a turning point in determining victory or defeat, a precious moment that can save a life, a dividing line between success and failure, a key moment for achieving goals, an opportunity window for decision-making, and an important moment in creating history. In this brief yet valuable time, we need to fully utilize our abilities and wisdom, seize opportunities, and face challenges to achieve success and earn respect. Therefore, cherishing every minute is equivalent to cherishing our lives. I believe that in Teacher Wang Dan's eyes, her class is invaluable, with every word being precious, to the extent that she does not want anyone to miss even a minute. I deeply regret missing that one minute.

Secondly, I need to reflect on the reasons behind my behavior. Being one minute late indicates that I was not attentive to the career planning course. I was engrossed in my pre-planned four years of life and focused on my hobbies and career planning, which led me to overlook Teacher Wang Dan's excellent class. I realized that I was not adequately prepared that morning. I did not plan in advance how to get to the classroom and did not allow enough time to deal with potential unexpected situations. This approach was unwise and caused trouble for both myself and others. I will learn from this experience and be more cautious in managing my time and tasks in the future.

Finally, I want to apologize to my teacher and classmates. I know that my behavior should not have occurred, and there is no excuse to justify it. One minute may seem trivial, but I have come to deeply understand the impact of my poor behavior on everyone, and I am very sorry for that. I promise to take every college career planning class more seriously in the future. I believe that Teacher Wang Dan's course is much more practical and useful than my own pre-planned research; I also believe that following Teacher Wang Dan will lead me to find a better job than what I had planned. I will avoid letting similar situations happen again.

In conclusion, I want to express my apologies to my teacher and classmates once again. I acknowledge my mistakes and will learn from them. I believe that with everyone's understanding and support, I can become a better version of myself. Thank you all for your understanding and support!

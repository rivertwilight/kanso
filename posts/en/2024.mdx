2024 has been a fulfilling year for me personally.

## Personal Life

In the first half of the year, I felt like I was imprisoned at school and failed a course. I no longer feel ashamed about it; in fact, I even feel a bit proud when I think back. Excelling in exam-oriented education does not prove any real ability.

During the summer, I took a road trip to Siguniang Mountain, with less than 2000 kilometers of driving experience. The journey was thrilling yet safe.

I started my first real "job" at ByteDance. This marks the beginning of my professional career. The work wasn't particularly smooth; my department wasn't a core one, and the technical challenges were minimal. I ended this job at the beginning of 2025. The gains were substantial, mostly in terms of soft skills.

Thus, I spent almost no time in school during the second half of the year, briefly escaping a life I deeply despised and getting an early taste of society.

## Creation and Entrepreneurship

The most frequently asked questions this year were: What prompted you to get into front-end development? Why did you start a business? In fact, these two questions are the same. It all seems so natural, as if it were a mission I was born with. If I had to articulate the underlying thought, I would say, "I hope to influence a portion of people, bring them value, and change their way of life."

My initial dream was to "change the world," but later I realized I couldn't change everyone, so I decided to change a part of it.

### Hackathon Wins Three Awards

In Hangzhou, I participated in the AdventureX hackathon. Ultimately, we won **three first prizes**, achieving the best results among all teams present.

The private AI assistant we developed during the hackathon is ready to debut and has entered the beta testing phase. Dali is your smart memo, helping you organize all kinds of information in your life and allowing you to ask questions at any time.

Our goal is to address the shortcomings of Apple Intelligence and create a perfect alternative to Pixel Screenshots.

### A Brand New Geekits Launch

Geekits is my longest-running project, and it received a significant update this year. It features a brand new visual experience, multiple new functions, and improvements that make your user experience richer and smoother. This includes new tools, numerous bug fixes, and performance optimizations.

Additionally, I released native iOS and Android versions, allowing offline use of Geekits. In October, Geekits ranked among the top 200 paid apps on the App Store. At the same time, we achieved **Top 1 of the day** on the神器集 platform.

### FlowFerry Debuts

In August, I launched [FlowFerry](https://www.ygeeker.com/flowferry), aimed at helping you preserve internet content.

FlowFerry helps you **save web articles to your digital garden**. Just enter the article link, and FlowFerry will convert it into a beautifully formatted, offline-accessible article, sending it to Notion, Google Drive, PDF, Obsidian, and other knowledge repositories. It is perfect for those who love reading and building knowledge systems.

At the same time, FlowFerry is also an excellent "Read Later" tool. The carefully designed reading page allows you to immerse yourself in the article. Whether you're commuting home on the subway or spending time on a plane, FlowFerry can help you pick up and utilize your reading.

### A New Addition to the Browser Plugin Family

In 2023, I released my first open-source browser plugin, Timeline. This is my first plugin product, and it already has over 100 users. This year, I also created another small yet beautiful plugin, Currates, an immersive currency conversion tool. This plugin has been officially marked as a "**Quality Extension**" by Google.

In November, I also released a companion plugin for DrawLink, which helps you quickly create beautiful link cards from the current page.

### YGeeker Ecosystem Development

I put a lot of effort into developing the official website. I meticulously wrote **user guides** for each product, regardless of size, providing detailed instructions to ensure the best user experience.

In the AI era, the benefits of doing this are immense. Your product knowledge can be more quickly indexed by LLMs, especially well-structured documents.
